          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods
          include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed
          research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
          educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can
          take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has
          a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such
          stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school
          and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

          Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
          purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in
          a school environment with classrooms of multiple students learning
          together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school
          systems are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all
          educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum,
          organizational models, design of the physical learning spaces (e.g.
          classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment,
          class size, educational activities, and more

          The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was
          created by UNESCO as a statistical base to compare education
          systems.[16] In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields,
          though the fields were later separated out to form a different
          project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels,
          created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three
          levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new
          sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes,
          which target children below the age of 3 years
